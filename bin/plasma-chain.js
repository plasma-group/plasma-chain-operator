Note that Plasma Chains require a constant connection to the Ethereum network.
You can set your Ethereum node in your config file located: ${configFile.toString().yellow}
(All configs & DB files are located in this directory--I promise I won't pollute your home directory!)
Right now your Web3 HTTP provider is set to: ${config.web3HttpProvider.blue}

To deploy a new Plasma Chain, use the following commands:

1) ${'$ plasma-chain account new'.green}  # create a new account

2) ${(isRinkeby) ? rinkebyStep2 : customStep2}

3) ${(isRinkeby) ? rinkebyStep3 : customStep3}

4) ${'$ plasma-chain start'.green} # start your new Plasma Chain
You can also view your local block explorer at http:127.0.0.1:8000

[optional]
5) ${'$ plasma-chain testSwarm'.green} # spam your Plasma Chain with tons of test transactions 😁
